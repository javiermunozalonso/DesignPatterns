# DesignPatterns

Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Design patterns are intended to:

- Provide collections of reusable elements in in the design of software systems

- Avoid reiteration in searching for solutions to problems already known and solved previously

- Formalize a common vocabulary among designers

- STandarize the way the design is done

- Facilitate the learning of new generations of designers by condensing existing knowledge

Depending on the level of abstraction or the utility, we can find these categories:

- Creational pattern: focusing on the object creation mechanism, trying to create objects in a better way depending on the situation

- Structural pattern: focusing on the way the entities relationships are made

- Behavioral pattern: focusing on how the communications between objects are made

## Creational Pattern

### Builder

The Builder is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation
